# Note to the Coding Agent:  If you are reading this it means you are bootstrapping
# a new project.  run_tests.sh should be responsible for running all tests in the project,
# including backend and frontend tests.  It should ensure that all necessary dependencies
# are installed and that the environment is properly set up before running the tests.
# Remove this preamble after the first implementation is made.
