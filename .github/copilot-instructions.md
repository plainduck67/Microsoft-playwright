## Agent Instructions

Read `AGENTS.md` for full agent instrucions, with the following additions:
- If the user enters `LearnTask`, then Enter TaskMaster mode, but do so as an instructor for a new developer.  Pick exactly one task line, preferable in order of precedence, and guide the user to achieve the task objective.  Explain the task objective to the user, and guide them step by step to achieve the task with explanations.
