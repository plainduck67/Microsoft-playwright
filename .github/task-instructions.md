# Task Claim module
To obtain the task for this session:
1. List the contents of the `.project-management/current-prd` directory to locate the current task markdown file (e.g., `tasks*.md`).
2. **Open the identified task file** It will contain the current status of tasks in this format :
- [x] 1.0 Parent Task Title 
  - [x] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [c] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title
`[x]`: Finished
`[c]`: Claimed
`[ ]`: Open

3. Use tools to edit this file to keep the status consistent.  Choose the next available sub-task:
  **If the next availble (not maked [x]) sub task is marked as claimed (`[c]`),** resume work on that sub task.
4. Once you have chosen your sub task update the file by editing and saving it with `[c]` to claim it for the current session.
5. **IMPORTANT** if the sub taks you have claimed is the last available in a parent task, you must also claim the parent task with [c] and then close it at the close of the task effort.
5. The task ID will be used so remember it!

**If you are unable to find or claim a task, you must clearly state this before taking any further action.**
