# PRD: Launch & Visit One Page (Phase 2)

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature implements Phase 2 of the Click Adventure project: launching Playwright, opening a browser/page, navigating to a Wikipedia URL, and exiting cleanly. This builds upon the console skeleton from Phase 1 by introducing browser automation capabilities. The goal is to establish a reliable browser lifecycle management pattern that will serve as the foundation for all subsequent phases.

## 2. Goals

- Establish reliable browser launch and cleanup patterns using Playwright for .NET
- Successfully navigate to a Wikipedia page and confirm the page loads
- Support both headed and headless browser modes for development and production scenarios
- Implement proper error handling and logging for browser operations
- Create a clean separation between browser orchestration logic and the console runner

## 3. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to run the application in headed mode so that I can visually debug browser interactions during development
- As a developer, I want to run the application in headless mode so that it can run efficiently in CI/CD environments
- As a user, I want the application to handle network failures gracefully so that temporary connectivity issues don't crash the program
- As a developer, I want detailed error logging so that I can troubleshoot browser launch and navigation issues
- As a user, I want the application to start from a configurable Wikipedia page so that I can test different starting points

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must launch a Playwright browser instance using Chromium
2. The system must support both headed and headless browser modes via configuration
3. The system must navigate to a Wikipedia URL and wait for the page to fully load
4. The system must verify successful page navigation by checking the page title contains "Wikipedia"
5. The system must cleanly dispose of browser resources (page, context, browser) when the operation completes
6. The system must log browser launch, navigation, and cleanup events
7. The system must handle and log errors for browser launch failures, navigation timeouts, and cleanup issues
8. The system must allow the starting Wikipedia URL to be configured via appsettings.json
9. The system must exit with appropriate status codes (0 for success, non-zero for failures)
10. The system must implement a timeout for page navigation (default 30 seconds)

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Taking screenshots (reserved for Phase 3)
- Link extraction or interaction (reserved for Phase 4)
- Multiple page navigation (reserved for Phase 5+)
- Support for browser types other than Chromium
- Advanced browser options (proxy, user agent customization, etc.)
- Retry logic for failed operations (will be addressed in later phases if needed)

## 6. Design Considerations

- The browser lifecycle management should be encapsulated in the ClickAdventure.Core library
- Console output should clearly indicate the current operation (launching browser, navigating to page, etc.)
- Error messages should be user-friendly while technical details are logged to files
- The application should fail fast on configuration errors (invalid URLs, missing settings)

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Must use Playwright for .NET NuGet package
- Browser launch should use default Chromium settings for consistency
- Page navigation should use Playwright's built-in auto-waiting capabilities
- Configuration should extend the existing Config.cs class from Phase 1
- Logging should integrate with the existing SimpleFileLogger from Phase 1
- The main logic should be implemented in ClickAdventure.Core and invoked from ClickAdventure.Runner

## 8. Success Metrics

- Application successfully launches browser and navigates to Wikipedia in both headed and headless modes
- All browser resources are properly disposed (no hanging browser processes)
- Error conditions are properly caught and logged without crashing the application
- Page navigation completes within the timeout period for valid Wikipedia URLs
- Configuration changes (URL, browser mode) take effect without code changes

## 9. Open Questions

- Should the application support custom user agents to avoid potential bot detection?
- Should there be a configuration option for browser timeout values?
- Should the application validate Wikipedia URLs before attempting navigation?

New concept: Browser/Context/Page lifecycle, headed vs headless."
