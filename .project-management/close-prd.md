# Coding Agent Review Instructions

## Purpose
This document provides step-by-step instructions for the coding agent to perform a critical review of the current PRD (Product Requirements Document) and associated tasks, and to take appropriate follow-up actions based on the review.

---

## Steps

1. **Open the Current PRD and Tasks Files**
   - Locate and open the current PRD file(s) in `.project-management/current-prd/prd.*.md`.
   - Locate and open the current tasks file(s) (e.g., `.project-management/current-prd/tasks.*.md`).

2. **Review Changes**
   - Carefully review the changes documented in the PRD and tasks files.
   - Compare these changes against the current codebase to determine if the code accurately reflects the documented requirements and tasks.

3. **Critical Review**
   - Assess whether any additional changes, bug fixes, or improvements are necessary to align the codebase with the PRD and tasks.

4. **Take Action Based on Review**
   - **If changes are deemed necessary:**
    - Make the changes needed.
    - Edit the relevant `tasks.*.md` file to add a follow-up review task describing the  changes made.
   - **If no further changes are needed:**
     - Move all files from `.project-management/current-prd/` to `.project-management/closed-prd/` to indicate the PRD has been reviewed and closed.

## Notes
- Ensure all actions are logged or tracked as appropriate for project management and traceability.
- If you encounter any ambiguity or missing information, escalate for clarification before proceeding.
