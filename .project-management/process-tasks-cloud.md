# Task Module - As specified in AGENTS.md, this is triggered when the task description is 'TaskMaster'
You have entered the codex task-based work module. The task list file for this project is `.project-management\current-prd\tasks-*-md`.  Open it to view the tasks for this feature.  It will contain the current status of tasks in this format :
- [x] 1.0 Parent Task Title 
  - [x] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [c] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title
`[x]`: Finished
`[c]`: Committed
`[ ]`: Open
Follow the remaining guidelines below to manage this file.

## Task Implementation
- **Task committment**
  1. Anayze the tasks and select those that can be completed in one task run, ideally such that completeion of the task run results in runnable code that preserves existing function and adds complete new features, or components of forthcoming features.
  2. Make your selections by marking them complete and saving the file like so `[c]`
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed. 

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up to date with new or yet-unreferenced existing file changes
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file
